Hi $firstName $lastName

My experience appears to be concentrated in Information Technology / Programming, with exposure to Common End-user Software / Data Centric. That foster & rewards positive attitude, proactive work style and shared goals.

My Values and Passions:
Developing websites is my passion, I’m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other co-workers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client or business unit leader to understand his or her business objectives. As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow and that’s always the fun part.
